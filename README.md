## Songs3
This is an app that I made when I was in highscool. It is simply a digital version of a songs book. It's not anything extraordinary, but every skill that went into its developement was completely self-taught. Had I been writing this app now, the code would have been a lot more readable and would have followed better programing practices. But since this is something that I made before going to university, I decided to share it.

Go to app->src->main to see the source code.

It was made for a Russian speaking church, so the UI and most of the content is also in Russian. Feel free to check it out on Google Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.eduard.butka.songs&hl=en_CA&gl=US&pli=1
